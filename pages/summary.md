# What is multimorbidity?
The term multimorbidity describes a situation where a person lives with at least two health conditions at the same time (these can be physical or mental health problems). These conditions are not necessarily caused by, or related, to each other. Multimorbidity can determine the type of care someone receives. Clinical guidelines often focus on one condition, overlooking that someone may have other health problems.

There are many reasons why people develop multiple health conditions, including their genes, injury, treatment side effects, or due to having other health conditions. People with multiple conditions may receive lower quality care, spend more time accessing healthcare, take more medications, and can feel that taking care of their health is a "full time job".

## Why does this matter to people with allergic conditions?
In the UK, one in five people have allergic conditions, like asthma and eczema; many live with multimorbidity. Living with multimorbidity can lead to poor mental and physical health, making it hard for people to take part in day-to-day activities including going to work and taking part in family life. In addition, allergic conditions and multimorbidity are costly financially, both for the person living with them and for the health service.

## Why do we need this study?
We need to better understand how and why people with common allergic conditions are more likely to develop multimorbidity. It is important to hear first-hand from people about their experiences living with, and managing, multiple
conditions. Through an understanding of the lived experience, we can work to try and identify, treat and even prevent multimorbidity, thus providing better care for the individuals themselves and reducing the financial, emotional and practical impact for both patients and the health service.

## Our study
To help us better understand multimorbidity in people with allergic conditions, we will:
1. Use information from anonymised GP records to understand patterns and pathways of multimorbidity in people with
allergic conditions.
2. Identify reasons why multimorbidity occurs in people with allergic conditions and how and why multiple health conditions develop over time.
3. Explore how people manage life with multiple conditions (interviews) along with the financial implications and broader
aspects of burden (health data).
