# Are you a patient with eczema and/or asthma? 
If you would like to get involved in our research then please [get in touch](mailto:alasdair.henderson1@lshtm.ac.uk). 

Do people with asthma or skin conditions develop adverse health problems more than those without? Why?
Contribute to several projects investigating adverse health problems using large amounts of information collected when people visit their doctor, 
comparing people with asthma, eczema or psoriasis to a similar group of people without these conditions.  

We are looking for people who have experienced asthma or eczema to join our research group. 
Workload will be flexible but could include contributing ideas, reviewing work and helping interpret results.
