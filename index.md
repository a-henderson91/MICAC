A multidisciplinary team of scientists researching the possibility of multiple conditions in people that also have **asthma** or **eczema**

## Background
People are often medically treated according to one primary condition, whcih can then account for other secondary condtions (co-morbidities). For example, illness with COVID-19 and obesity as a comorbidity. Multimorbidity is different in that no single condition is primary, but multiple conditions in patients can increase suffering and health care costs.
