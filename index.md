A multidisciplinary team of scientists researching the possibility of multiple conditions in people that also have **asthma** or **eczema**

## Background
Often medicine treats people according to one primary condition and can account for other secondary condtions (co-morbidities). For example, illness with COVID-19
and obesity as a comorbidity. Multimorbidity is different in that no one condition is primary but multiple conditions in patients can increase suffering and 
health care costs.
